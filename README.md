## Overview
This project involves a comprehensive analysis of Netflix's movies and TV shows data using SQL. The goal is to extract valuable insights and answer various business questions based on the dataset. The following README provides a detailed account of the project's objectives, business problems, solutions, findings, and conclusions.

## Objectives
- Analyze the distribution of content types (movies vs TV shows).
- Identify the most common ratings for movies and TV shows.
- List and analyze content based on release years, countries, and durations.
- Explore and categorize content based on specific criteria and keywords.

## Dataset
The data for this project is sourced from the Kaggle dataset:
- **Dataset Link:** [Movies dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shivamb/netflix-shows?resource=download)

## Schema
```sql
--DROP table if exists netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix
(
	show_id      VARCHAR(6),
    type         VARCHAR(10),
    title        VARCHAR(150),
    director     VARCHAR(208),
    casts        VARCHAR(1000),
    country      VARCHAR(150),
    date_added   VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating       VARCHAR(10),
    duration     VARCHAR(15),
    listed_in    VARCHAR(100),
    description  VARCHAR(250)

);
```
## Business Problems and Solutions

### 1. Count the Number of Movies vs TV shows
```sql
SELECT
	type,
	Count(*) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY type;
```
### 2. Find the most common rating for movies and TV shows
``` sql
SELECT
	type,
	rating
FROM 
	(SELECT 
		type,
		rating,
		COUNT(*),
		RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY type ORDER BY COUNT(*) DESC) as ranking
	FROM netflix
	GROUP BY 1,2
) as t1
WHERE 
	ranking = 1
```
### 3. List all movies released in a specific year (e.g., 2020)
```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE 
	type = 'Movie' 
	AND
	release_year = 2020
```
### 4. Find the top 5 countires with the most content on Netflix
```sql
SELECT 
	UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(country, ',')) as new_country,
	COUNT(show_id) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
ORDER by total_content DESC
LIMIT 5
```

### 5. Identify the longest movie?
```sql
SELECT 
	*
FROM netflix
WHERE type = 'Movie'
ORDER BY SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::INT DESC
```
### 6. Find content added in the last 5 years
```sql
SELECT
*
FROM netflix
WHERE TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY') >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '5 years'
```
### 7. Find all the movies/TV shows by director 'Rajiv Chilaka'!
```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE director LIKE '%Rajiv Chilaka%'

```
### 8. List all TV shows with more than 5 seasons
```sql
SELECT *
FROM netflix
WHERE 
	TYPE = 'TV Show'
	AND
	SPLIT_PART(duration, ' ', 1)::numeric > 5

```
### 9. Count the number of content items in each genre
```sql
SELECT 
	UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(listed_in, ',')) as genre,
	COUNT(show_id) as total_content
FROM netflix
GROUP BY 1
```

### 10. Find the average numbers of content release by India on netflix each year. Then return top 5 year with highest avg content release !

```sql
SELECT 
	EXTRACT(YEAR FROM TO_DATE(date_added, 'Month DD, YYYY')) as year,
	COUNT (*) as yearly_content,
	ROUND(
	COUNT(*)::numeric/(SELECT COUNT(*) FROM netflix WHERE country = 'India'):: numeric *100, 2) as avg_content_per_year
FROM netflix
Where country ='India'
GROUP BY 1
```
### 11. List all movies that are documentaries
```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE listed_in LIKE '%Documentaries'
```

### 12. Find all content without a director
```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE director IS NULL

```
### 13. Find how many movies actor 'Salman Khan' appeared in last 10 years!
```sql
SELECT * FROM netflix
WHERE 
	casts LIKE '%Salman Khan%'
	AND 
	release_year > EXTRACT(YEAR FROM CURRENT_DATE) - 10
```

### 14. Find the top 10 actors who have appeared in the highest number of movies produced in India.

```sql
SELECT 
	UNNEST(STRING_TO_ARRAY(casts, ',')) as actor,
	COUNT(*)
FROM netflix
WHERE country ILIKE '%India'
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY 2 DESC
LIMIT 10
```
### 15: Categorize the content based on the presence of the keywords 'kill' and 'violence' in the description field. Label content containing these keywords as 'Bad' and all other content as 'Good'. Count how many items fall into each category.

```sql
WITH new_table
AS (
SELECT 
*,
        CASE 
        WHEN 
			description ILIKE '%kill%' OR 
			description ILIKE '%violence%' THEN 'Bad'
            ELSE 'Good'
        END category
    FROM netflix
)
    
SELECT 
	category,
	COUNT(*) as total_content
FROM new_table
GROUP BY 1

```
